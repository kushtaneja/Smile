 # Rock, Paper, Scissors (Roshambo!)
 Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game for two players‚Äîyou and a robot opponent. Each player chooses an action that represents an object (rock¬†‚úä, paper üñê, or scissors‚úåÔ∏è), and each action beats one of the other actions:
 * ‚úä beats ‚úåÔ∏è (rock crushes scissors)
 * ‚úåÔ∏è beats üñê (scissors cut paper)
 * üñê beats ‚úä (paper covers rock)
 
 The robot opponent chooses actions randomly.
 
 If both players choose the same action, that round ends in a tie. The first player to win three rounds wins the game.
 
 When you‚Äôre ready, move on to the next page to personalize your game.
